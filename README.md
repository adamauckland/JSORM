Databases! In the browser! With JavaScript!

Who doesn't like databases? Not me, I love them. Can't get enough of them. When I'm not making databases, I'm thinking of databases to build databases.

So what the world needs now is more database ORMs. Probably in a trendy language like Ruby or Go.

So I made one in JavaScript instead. It only works on Safari, Chrome and Safari on mobile but I'm sure FireFox will catch up one day.
